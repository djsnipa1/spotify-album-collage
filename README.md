### About
A program that creates an image collage from album covers from recently saved Spotify songs.

I came up with this idea when I wanted an album collage as my desktop wallpaper and figured others might want to do the same. Kind of similar to when I had songs on iTunes (before I jumped on the Spotify train in 2012) and it would create a screen saver of all the albums.

This took about under a day in real time because I wasn't familiar with the PIL library at all and, therefore, had to spend a lot of that time troubleshooting errors.

### Current Functionality
- User can generate a basic collage in the notebook

### Future Features
- Clean up some variables and hard coded numbers
- Include instructions on how to run notebook
- Collage based on colors
  - So, if a user selects a particular color it will make all the images mainly feature that color making the entire collage primarily be that color as well
  - Color picker
- Web application
  - Expectations
    - User can choose to use playlist or saved songs/albums
